# Java
#### Access modifiers
* A private member (i) is only accessible within the same class as it is declared.
* A member with no access modifier (j) is only accessible within classes in the same package.
* A protected member (k) is accessible within all classes in the same package and within subclasses in other packages.
* A public member (l) is accessible to all classes (unless it resides in a module that does not export the package it is declared in).
